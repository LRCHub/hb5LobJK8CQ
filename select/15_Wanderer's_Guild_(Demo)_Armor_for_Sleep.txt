I can speak when I want to
Employ my voice till it burns
Through the core of my own throat
Speak until the demand's gone

You should be downstairs with them
You're wasting your time again
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
I don't want to talk right now

Thank you for your concern
I can speak till the world ends
To make up for all that I left out
I'll register with The Wanderer's Guild

And be a nomad with a billion words
You should be downstairs with them
You're wasting your time again
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now

I don't want to talk right now

Thank you for your concern
Air conditioning, you can stay quiet all night
Air conditioning, you can stay quiet all night
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
I don't want to talk right now
Thank you for your concern
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
Listen I'm fine now, listen and find out, listen I'm fine now
I don't want to talk right now
Thank you for your concern
