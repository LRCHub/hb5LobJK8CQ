I would look for the sun
The feel of it coming up
And the light is all I become
Your eyes reflecting something

I see how it's all been done
And now was it all for nothing
The night is out for blood
The stars are out for love

And when the city's quiet
I think about, I think about it
In the subtle silence
I think about, I think about it

I wanna run throuh the night with the wanderers
Take me away
I wanna float through the sky like a voyager
So let me escape

Hold me now
Cause I'll run away
Just not today

When the daylight is gone
And the palms are just a shadow
In the sillouette of one
I see and I wanna follow

I feel a dream comin' on
And I know it wasn't all for nothing
I'm ready to move on
Yeah I'm ready, I'm ready

And when the city's quiet
I think about, I think about it
In the subtle silence
I think about, I think about it

I wanna run throuh the night with the wanderers
Take me away
I wanna float through the sky like a voyager
So let me escape

Hold me now
Cause I'll run away
Just not today
Just not today
